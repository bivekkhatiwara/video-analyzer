To ensure maximum compatibility and definitively fix this, I recommend adding `libatlas-base-dev` and `libsuitesparse-dev`, which are frequently needed dependencies for complex libraries like NumPy and SciPy (which OpenCV may use).

I will now update your **Canvas `Dockerfile`** to include these last two packages, which are almost always required for stable OpenCV deployments on a slim image.

### Summary of Action:

1.  **Commit the updated `app.py`** (the file I edited above, removing the Windows path).
2.  **Commit the updated `Dockerfile`** (the Canvas I edited above, adding the final system packages).
3.  **Trigger a new deployment** using the **Docker Web Service** option on Render.

These two fixes should guarantee a successful build and launch of your service.
